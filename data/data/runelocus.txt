[SIZE=6][FONT=Arial Black]About me:[/FONT][/SIZE]
Before i introduce my self, i was a member here before runelocus made an account reset in 2010, i made an acc on the first day runelocus was relaunched again. My old user name was "yourgirlwantsme", you can search it up. I was permanently banned for almost 2 and a half years. I did not have that much knowledge in java back than. Since these 2 and a half years passed i have been programming in java. Back than i used to call my myself a programmer but deep down inside i knew iam just a dependent "leecher" or whatever u call it. Now i am proud to say i am a programmer and deep down inside i know that i can do alot of stuff and take on challenges whatsoever.

I chose the 562 revision because i wanted to challenge myself and make it better than most of the 562's that have been developed.
