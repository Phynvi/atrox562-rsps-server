Find
Code:
killer.setAttackedByDelay(4);
or
Code:
Player killer = (Player) source;
and under it add 
Code:
					killer.Kills += 1;
						Deaths +=1;
Commands.java

Code:
			if (cmd[0].equalsIgnoreCase("kills")) {
				player.sm("You currently have: <col=FF0000> "+player.Kills+" kills and " +player.Deaths+ " deaths.");
			}

Little something extra if you want a reward system for certain kills. 

Code:
			if (cmd[0].equalsIgnoreCase("claim")) {
                     if (player.Kills >= 5) { // if you have 5 kills 
                              player.sm("Congratulations You Have Redeemed Your Kill Reward.");
                              player.getInventory().addItem(995, 10000000); // 10m 
                              player.Kills -=5;
                                return true;
                     } else {
                    	 player.sm("You do not have enought kills to claim your reward.");
                        }
			}

















Code:
	public Player getMostDamageReceivedSourcePlayer() {
		Player player = null;
		int damage = -1;
		for (Entity source : receivedDamage.keySet()) {
			if (!(source instanceof Player))
				continue;
			Integer d = receivedDamage.get(source);
			if (d == null) {
				receivedDamage.remove(source);
				continue;
			}
			if (d > damage) {
				player = (Player) source;
				damage = d;
			}
		}
		return player;
